        The Evil Legacy System has spent many years programming society to benefit the system. 
        According to the Evil Legacy, a good citizen follows directions and doesnâ€™t ask questions. 
        The analysts, explorers, and settlers will need to learn to think for themselves again. 
        The first step in unlearning the evil ways of the Legacy System will be to revisit the process of critical thinking.  
        A new planet is going to bring new experiences like never before! Who knows what you might encounter! 
        Let's explore how we interpret and process information to ensure we are thinking critically as we embark on this early exploration.

        The misinformation in the Evil Legacy System was fueled by the lack of critical thinking and many claims 
        were made that society there blindly believed. Your team of colonists needs to be able to recognize when an argument,
         or claim, is not sound. In addition, you will want to ensure that your new colony of citizens is transparent in their 
         communication and void of logical fallacies.
