      statement.
        The Evil Legacy Systems have been controlling the way stories are told in order to hold onto their power by discouraging change. My techno-anarchist monk programmers have equipped all of our future colonists with adaptive educational experiences to use as tools in retaking the power of human curiosity, creativity, and compassion.

            The Evil Legacy Systems use misinformation to obscure their evil plots and flood communication channels with tricks designed to create confusion and cloud judgement -- preventing people from developing solid critical thinking habits.

            You must be equipped to recognize and defuse unsound conjecture before it can negatively impact your team. That will require a strong understanding of logical fallacies.
